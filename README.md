Challenge 1: Code Refractor

Welcome! This is my first project ever posted onto github, still learning, so please do give me feedback on how I can make this github repository/code better. This is my week 2 challenge 1 "Code Refractor" I  was given a html and a css code and my instructions were to make the code more efficient and condensed. You can never leave a code you looked over or used untouched you have to clean it up. ~ Scout code. 
I learned that cleaning up a code makes it more efficient for all parties. Also, making sure that the code follows the symantic flow of html/css allows for a neater and cleaner code overall. 
The problems I solved were the linkage fix on the html with the tab link with search engine optimizer. Cleaned up the css to allow it to flow the symantic flow. Label the categories of each section for better understanding of the css file.
A couple challenges I faced on this assignment were where do I start. I never know where and how to start. I also faced a couple problem reflowing the css file, but after working at it for a little while I got it to work.
